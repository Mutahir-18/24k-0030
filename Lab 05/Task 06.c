the answer is 30 because in the first part 5 is 
not greater than 8 thus the ternary operator goes
to false statement which is 1!=2<5 due to precedence 
of operators,first it will check < or > and then not 
equal to operator, thus 2<5 us true and 1!=2 is false
the ternary will go to false statement which is 30
