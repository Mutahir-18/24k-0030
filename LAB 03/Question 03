A customer asks the IT firm to develop a program in C language, which can take tax rate and salary from
the user on runtime and then calculate the tax, the user has to pay and the salary he/she will have after
paying the tax. This information is then provided to the user.

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int Salary,Tax,NewSalary;
	float TaxRate;
	printf("Enter the Salary here:");
	scanf("%d",&Salary);
	printf("Enter the Tax Rate here (not in percentage):");
	scanf("%f",&TaxRate);
	Tax=Salary*TaxRate;
	NewSalary=Salary-Tax;
	printf("you have to pay:%d tax\n and the salary would be after the tax:%d",Tax,NewSalary);
	return(0);
}
