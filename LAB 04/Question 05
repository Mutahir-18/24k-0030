An online shopping store is providing discounts on the items due to the Eid. If 
the cost of items is less than 2000 it will give a discount up to 5%. If the cost of 
shopping is 2000 to 4000, a 10% discount will be applied. If the cost of 
shopping is 4000 to 6000, a 20% discount will be applied. If it's more than 6000 
then a 35% discount will be applied to the cost of shopping. Print the actual 
amount, saved amount and the amount after discount. The Minimum amount 
eligible for a discount is 500.
