Write a C program which asks the user for an input (any number) and only 
accepts numbers that are (positive, multiple of 2 and divisible by 10). Any 
other number should be discarded (Write the condition in a single statement 
no nesting)

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int num;
	printf("Enter the number:");
	scanf("%d",&num);
	if (num>0 && num%2==0 && num%10==0){
		printf("The number is correct");
		}
	else {
		printf("The numbrer is not accepetd");
	}
	return(0);
}
